# Extra-Tidal Star Chemical, Machine-learning led automated identification process
This project creates a chemical-based, automated, machine-learning led search for extra-tidal stars of globular clusters.
It identifies cluster member stars based on a kinematics and chemical abundance similarity analysis carried out by t-SNE and UMAP and automated through DBSCAN to locate spatially, kinematically, and chemically similar stars to represent the cluster population.
Then it identifies chemically similar stars to those cluster members that are beyond the tidal radius, hence the name extra-tidal.
These results are verified through a metallicity comparison to galaxy stars within the field of clusters.
Overall, 24 clusters yielded successful extra-tidal identifications with a total of 831 extra-tidal candidate stars identified.
